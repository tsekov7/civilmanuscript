<h2>About Civil Manuscript</h2>

<p>Civil Manuscript is a historical Cyrillic font inspired by late 19th-century Bulgarian handwriting and orthography. The design is based on the 1879 "Petit manuel pour apprendre la langue Bulgare" by P. V. Gorbanoff, published in Sofia. This font aims to preserve the authentic aesthetics of extended Cyrillic glyphs such as ?, ?, and ?.</p>

<p>It is crafted for historical reconstructions, cultural heritage editions, and educational uses related to the Bulgarian Revival period and the pre-1945 orthography. The font respects both the visual form and the orthographic standards of that era, providing designers and researchers with a tool to recreate period-accurate texts.</p>

<p>Some glyphs in "Civil Manuscript" are based on or adapted from open-licensed fonts, particularly "Great Vibes" by the Great Vibes Pro Project Authors (licensed under SIL Open Font License). These elements were modified in full compliance with the OFL terms, and the resulting font remains under the same license.</p>
